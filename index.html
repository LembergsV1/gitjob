                Following two years of false starts, 2023 looks to be the proper beginning of the PS5-Xbox Series generation, as Unreal Engine 5 support builds and an increasing number of developers drop support for Sony and Microsoft’s last-gen consoles. Starfield, Spider-Man 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy 16 are only a handful of games built exclusively for new hardware, though PS4, Xbox One, and especially Switch owners have plenty to look forward to as well.

                With dozens of games delayed to 2023, a greater emphasis on new-gen hardware, and at least one major exclusive from each platform holder, next year easily houses the most exciting games lineup since the changing of the console guard in 2020.

                so with that being said here are some of the biggest games coming out in 2023.

            <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Star Wars Jedi Survivor.</h2>
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
                Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the sequel to Respawn Entertainment’s Jedi: Fallen Order set five years later. The game continues the story of a more mature and more rugged Cal Kestis, who remains on the run as the Empire’s most-wanted fugitive. Expectations are high for Survivor, as its predecessor is the second best-selling Star Wars game of all time in the U.S.

                Resident Evil 4 Remake
Spooky season comes early next year as, following Dead Space in January and Sons of the Forest in February, Capcom will release its ground-up remake of Resident Evil 4 in March.

RE 4 Remake follows Capcom’s recent reimaginings of Resident Evil 2 and 3, retaining the original game’s foundational elements while adding updated gameplay and a visual update. The story also has been “reconstructed” to account for the series’ narrative progression over the last 17 years.

The original 2005 Resident Evil 4 is widely considered one of the best survival horror games ever made.

            <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Spider-Man 2.</h2>
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
                Sony’s biggest first-party game of the year is Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The PS5-exclusive sequel continues the stories of both Peter Parker and Miles Morales while introducing Venom into the mix, voiced by Candyman actor Tony Todd. Marvel’s Bill Rosemann said the sequel is “darker” than the original, calling Spider-Man 2 the Empire Strikes Back to the first game’s A New Hope
